Tests:

- response latencies over time (per request!!, good to know which request slows down server)
- response times over time, to see which URL performs the quickest in returning a message
- response times percentiles, 90.0 on x-axis shows how 90% of the tests finish within that time
- response times vs threads, see how response time reacts to increased number of threads
- transaction throughput vs threads, number of estimated transactions per second, allows you to see
when the server starts peaking at which number of threads.
- transactions per second
- aggregate report, gives a summary
- results tree: requests and data, good for troubleshooting



Terms:
- Latency: delay in 
- Throughput: the amount of data 



JMeter:
- customize thread group plugin
- template recording
- able to make delays on threads with ultimate thread group
- HTTP authorization manager
- run threads groups consucetively (in test plan) om thread groups zich na elkaar af te laten spelen
